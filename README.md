# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose
Maria provided school data for the school district. She would like results analyzed and presented in various ways to compare passing students (in math, reading and overall) by school, grade, school type, and school budget. This will help the school district make appropriate decisions about finding and ideally improve student success.
