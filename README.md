# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
Maria provided school data for the school district. She would like results analyzed and presented in various ways to compare passing students (in math, reading and overall) by school, grade, school type, and school budget. Maria brought a concern forward that there were errors in the 9th grade data for Thomas High School. She asked us to remove this data from the analysis. This will help the school district make appropriate decisions about finding and ideally improve student success.


## Analysis

After cleaning up the data to remove prefixes/suffixes and omitting the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School in the analysis we were able to combine the student data with the school data into one DataFrame.
